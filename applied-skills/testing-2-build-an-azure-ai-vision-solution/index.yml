  This learning path guides you through creating AI-enabled computer vision solutions using Azure AI. It covers how to process and analyze images and videos, extract information, and develop intelligent applications with Azure Cognitive Services. You will learn to implement computer vision capabilities such as image classification, object detection, and optical character recognition (OCR), a technology that converts images of text into machine-readable text, using Azure's pre-built models and custom vision services. The path includes hands-on interactive exercises and real-world practical examples to help you develop and deploy computer vision solutions effectively.
