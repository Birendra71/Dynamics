  The “Configure SIEM security operations using Microsoft Sentinel” learning path is an intermediate-level training designed for Security Operations Analysts to learn how to set up and manage Microsoft Sentinel for effective security information and event management. It covers creating and managing workspaces, connecting log sources from Microsoft services and Windows hosts, detecting threats with analytics rules, and automating responses to incidents. Learners are expected to have basic knowledge of Azure, familiarity with Sentinel, and some experience with Kusto Query Language (KQL). Through six modules, the path provides hands-on guidance to configure, monitor, detect, and automate SIEM operations using Microsoft Sentinel in real-world security environments.
