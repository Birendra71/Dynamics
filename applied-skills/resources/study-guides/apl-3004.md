## 🚀 Create Your First Flow

### Step 1: Choose a Trigger  
Start with a trigger like “When a new email arrives” or “When a record is created in Dataverse.”

### Step 2: Add Actions  
Include steps such as sending notifications, updating records, or calling an external API.

### Step 3: Test and Debug  
Use the run history and error messages to troubleshoot and refine your flow.

> 💡 Tip: Use **Compose** actions to inspect intermediate values and simplify debugging.
