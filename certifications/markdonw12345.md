# FAQ Help content updates

# Exam duration

The number of questions on a certification exam is subject to change as we make updates to ensure it aligns with current changes in the technology and job role. Most Microsoft Certification exams typically contain between 40-60 questions; however, the number can vary depending on the exam.

Exam time varies based on the type of exam you take.

| Exam type | Exam duration* | Seat duration* |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fundamentals exams | 45 minutes | 65 minutes |
| Associate and expert role-based exams without labs** | 100 minutes | 120 minutes |
| Associate and expert role-based exams that may contain labs** | 120 minutes | 140 minutes |
| Microsoft Office Specialist (MOS) exams | 50 minutes | 60 minutes |

*Exam duration refers to the amount of time that you have to complete the exam. Seat time refers to the amount of time that you should allocate for the exam. It includes the time needed to review the instructions, read and accept the HYPERLINK "https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/support/certification-exam-candidate-agreement"Microsoft Certification Exam Candidate Agreement, complete the exam questions, and provide comments after completing it (if you choose to do so).

**Because labs can be removed at any time due to Azure outages, bandwidth issues, etc., Microsoft does not provide a list of exams with labs. When you register for the exam, you will be provided with the exam time. When you launch the exam, carefully review the overview pages that provide information about what to expect on the exam, including if labs are available.

# Accessing Microsoft Learn during your certification exam

You can access [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/) as you complete your exam. However, this resource is intended to be used for those questions that describe problems where you may need to look something up on [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/). It is not something you should be leveraging to answer every question. If you do, you won’t be able to complete the exam in the time allotted, and that is by design.

Here's what you need to know about this resource:

You will have access to everything in the learn.microsoft.com domain except Q&A, Practice Assessments, and your profile.

Extra time has not been added.

The exam timer will continue as you explore Microsoft Learn content.

This resource is only available on role-based exams, not fundamentals or Microsoft Office Specialist (MOS) exams.

This resource will be available in the same languages in which the exam is available.



# Take a Practice Assessment

# Practice Assessments on Learn: Some exams have free Practice Assessments, available in multiple languages (exams may not be available in the same language), that are delivered through Learn to help you prepare for your exam.
Practice Assessments on Learn: Some exams have free Practice Assessments, available in multiple languages (exams may not be available in the same language), that are delivered through Learn to help you prepare for your exam.

These Practice Assessments are intended to provide an overview of the style, wording, and difficulty of the questions that you are likely to experience on this exam. These questions are not the same as what you will see on the exam nor is this document illustrative of the length of the exam or its complexity (e.g., you may see additional question types, multiple case studies, and possibly labs). These questions are examples only to provide insight into what to expect on the exam and help you determine if additional preparation is required.

If available, a link will be provided on the exam details page.

NOTE that practice tests for Microsoft Office Specialist (MOS) exams are [managed by Certiport](https://certiport.pearsonvue.com/Certifications/Microsoft/MOS/Practice).

To protect exam security and the value of our certifications, we don’t identify specific exam formats or question types before the exam. However, you can demo the role-based and fundamentals exam experience by visiting our “[exam sandbox](https://aka.ms/examdemo).” We created this experience to provide you with an opportunity to experience the exam before you take it. You will have an opportunity to interact with the different question types that you may see during the exam in the exam user interface. In addition, this experience includes the same introductory screens, instructions, help information, and [Microsoft Certification Exam Candidate Agreement](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/support/certification-exam-candidate-agreement) that you will see on your exam. As a result, using this sandbox should better prepare you for the exam experience and increase your familiarity with the user interface, how to navigate between pages, what action to take to answer each of the different question types, where information about the exam is located (time remaining, questions remaining, etc.), how to mark questions for review, and how to leave comments.


NOTE that Microsoft Office Specialist (MOS) exams are “Live-in-the-Application” and are very similar to the lab question type displayed above. You will be expected to perform tasks in the Office App that is the basis of the certification.
